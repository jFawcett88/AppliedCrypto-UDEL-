# AppliedCrypto-UDEL-
Code written for UDEL's Applied Crypto course.

You will need the Python Image Libray (PIL), PyCrypto, and hashlib.

imgBlockChain.py is to show how ECB, CBC, OFB, and CTR work while encoding/decoding an image.

example use:
imgBlockChain.py -ecb -Encode sample.png

NOTE* I need to convert this to Python 3.
